Simple, easy to use Shopify style pages for Spree 4.2 and up.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_pages', github: 'matthewkennedy/spree_pages'
    ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler

    ```ruby
    bundle install
    ```

3. Copy & run migrations

    ```ruby
    bundle exec rails g spree_pages:install
    ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_pages/factories'
```
