## Using Action Text
If you wish to use Rails 6 built in TRIX editor with Action Text for your pages set the following Spree config:

```ruby
    #In -> config/initializers/spree.rb
    config.pages_use_action_text = true
```
And make sure you have Action Text Installed, see this guide to using Action Text with Spree if needed.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_pages/factories'
```
