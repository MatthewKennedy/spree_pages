Simple, easy to use Shopify style pages for Spree 4.2 and up, with Action Text (TRIX rich text editor) ready via configs.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_pages', github: 'matthewkennedy/spree_pages', branch: 'main'
    ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler

    bundle install
    ```

3. Copy & run migrations

    bundle exec rails g spree_pages:install
    ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Configurations
If you wish to use Rails 6 built in TRIX rich text editor with Action Text for your pages set the following Spree config, and make sure you have Action Text installed. See this guide to using Action Text with Spree if needed.

```ruby
    #In -> config/initializers/spree.rb
    config.pages_use_action_text = true
```

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_pages/factories'
```
