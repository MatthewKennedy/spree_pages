    ```ruby
    gem 'spree_pages', github: 'matthewkennedy/spree_pages', branch: 'main'
    ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler

    ```

3. Copy & run migrations

    ```ruby
    bundle exec rails g spree_pages:install
    ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Configurations

If you wish to use Rails 6 built in TRIX rich text editor with Action Text for your pages set the following Spree config, and make sure you have Action Text installed.
See this guide to [Using Action Text with Spree](https://github.com/MatthewKennedy/spree_pages/blob/main/spree_actiontext.md)  if needed.

```ruby
    #In -> config/initializers/spree.rb
    SpreePages::Config.use_action_text = true
```

If you are not using Action Text but wish to use raw HTML in your pages you can use the following config:

```ruby
    #In -> config/initializers/spree.rb
    SpreePages::Config.use_raw_body_text = true
```

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_pages/factories'
```
